# PHYS-5070-Final-Project

This is my final project for PHYS 5070 SP23. My goal was to write a program that could calculate orbital transfer trajectories between any two bodies in a solar system given a variety of initial conditions. I had varied success with this project, mostly getting stuck dealing with the solver I used which proved to be very problematic.

I ended up making a little writeup in `FinalProject.ipynb`. It contains some of the steps that I took to solve the problem and my thinking as I worked through the project. I suggest referring to that if you want a description of the code. Other .ipynb notebooks contain some of the larger codes that I did not want to clutter that notebook up with.
